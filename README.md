# Project in Progress: Honors
This is what I have so far for my honors project. I am studying Classical Linear Modeling using Ordinary Least Squares, Generalized Linear Models, and Vector-Generalized Linear Models. I have examples using constriant amtrices and the Gamma distribution, an election example, and a small program for how iteratively-reweighted least squares is computed. My paper draft is attached.
