# Honors
This is what I have done for my honors project. I studied Classical Linear Modeling using Ordinary Least Squares, Generalized Linear Models, and Vector-Generalized Linear Models. I have examples using constriant amtrices and the Gamma distribution, an election example, and a small program for how iteratively-reweighted least squares is computed. My paper and presentation are attached.
